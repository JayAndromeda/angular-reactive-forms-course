      First let's attach our control to the input below. Let's give this input
      element a "type" of "number" and use the FormControl constructor to give
      it an initial value of 20. We'll also use vanilla html to apply a minimum
      value of 5 and a maximum of 25.
    </p>
  </forms-course-instructions>

  What is your favorite multiple of 5 that is greater than 0 and less than 30?
  <input type="number" [formControl]="control" min="5" max="25" step="5" />
</div>

<hr />

<div>
  <forms-course-instructions>
    <p>
      The html we added will limit users when using the up and down arrow keys,
      but a user will still be able to type in numbers that greater than our
      max, or lower than our min, or are not multiples of 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's fix this by subscribing to the `valueChanges` of our FormControl and
      adjusting the value held by the control when it does not confirm to the
      limitations that we want. To make things manageable, let's also set the
      `updateOn` config option of our FormControl to 'blur'.
    </p>
    <p>
      (NOTE: This in itself is not a great user experience, but it is helpful
      for us learning the machanics of FormControls. We'll see a better user
      experience for this in our section on Form Validation.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's implement a current value and a history in the spaces below (like we
      did in the previous example) to see how the value and valueChanges behave
      while our `onUpdate` for the control is set to "blur".
    </p>
  </forms-course-instructions>
  <pre>Your favorite multiple of 5 is: {{ control.value }}.</pre>
  <h5>History</h5>
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let value of controlValueHistory">{{ value }}</li>
  </ul>
  <button (click)="controlValueHistory = []">Reset History</button>
</div>
