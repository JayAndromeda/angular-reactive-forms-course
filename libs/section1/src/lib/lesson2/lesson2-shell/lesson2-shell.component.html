    In the previous lesson, we looked at the mechanics of a `FormControl`. In
    this section, we'll look at some details of a `FormGroup`, which is another
    extension of the the `AbstractForm` abstract class.

  <p>
    Note that `FormGroup`s when contructed take as an argument an object of
    named `AbstractForm`s. As such, we can create a `FormGroup` that contains
    both `FormControl`s and `FormGroup`s.
