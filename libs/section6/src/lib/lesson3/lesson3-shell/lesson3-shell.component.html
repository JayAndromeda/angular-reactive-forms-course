  <p>
    In this lesson, use table form and grid components to create a client-side
    table.
  </p>

  <p>
    Check out the resources in the `+state` directory for this section to help
    with the functionality. There is an NgRx implementation in `+state`, but the
    important part is to know that there's a selector called `heroSelector` that
    will provide an Observable of all available heroes.
