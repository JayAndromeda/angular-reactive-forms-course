  <p>
    For this exercise, let's use the hero form that we've used across the
    previous sections and wrap it in a ControlValueAccessor component.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll see in future lessons, this makes it much easier to deal with the Hero
    Object that the FormGroup contains, as well as facilitating re-use of this
    form across our application, and for composing more complex forms as we'll
    see in the upcoming section!
  </p>

  <p>
    The template is already provided to you here, simply add your
    implementations to the methods requried for the `ControlValueAccessor`
    interface to complete this exercise!
