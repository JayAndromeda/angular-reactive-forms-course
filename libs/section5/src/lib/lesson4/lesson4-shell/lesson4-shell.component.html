  <p>
    In this exercise, we'll implement the canDeactivate method of the component.
    Note that in the router info located in the module file for section 4, the
    `canDeactivate` property is already set to the ConfirmDiscardChangesGuard.
    This guard in turn is simply returning hte canDeactive method of the
    component, so this is already wired up to work assuming that the canDeactive
    method is properly implemented in the component.
  </p>

  <p>
    Provide your implemention by returning an Observable of true if no changes
    exist, or using the injected `MatDialog` to open a dialog with the
    `CompletedDiscardChangesDialogComponent`, and then emit a boolean value to
    correspond to the user's interaction with that dialog.
