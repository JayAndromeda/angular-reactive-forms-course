  <p>
    In this exercise, we'll use the parent form created in our previous lesson
    to implement our wizard proper. Looking at the template, the main
    implementation is already provided using the mat-card component of the
    @angular/material package. We'll need to uncomment the
    forms-course-wizard-form within the mat-content component.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following that, create your form within the tap operator piped onto the
    `configSettingsFromStore$` Observable (see the comment in the file), using
    the createcreateConfigSettingFormControl() factory function provided in the
    `wizard-form.utils.ts` file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once this is done, we can uncomment the `_formIsValid$` and `savePending$`
    implementations, and create our own implementation of the `_formHasChanges$`
    Observable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, implement the `discardChanges()` method, setting the value of the
    form to reflect the value of the store.
