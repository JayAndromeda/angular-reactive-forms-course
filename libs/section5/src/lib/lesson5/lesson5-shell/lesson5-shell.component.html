    In this exercise, we'll implement the ability to save the user's entries.
    The requirements dictate that before this happens, the user should be shown
    a dialog that displays a list of all the configurations and their old and
    new values for the user to confirm before the save is actually committed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the injected `MatDialog` to open a dialog with the
    `CompletedConfimationDialogComponent` with the proper data, and then
    dispatch a submitSaveRequest action to the store if the user does confirm
    the changes.
