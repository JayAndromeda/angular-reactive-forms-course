    In this exercise, we'll create our own
    <a
      href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ValidatorFn"
      target="_blank"
      class="alert-link"
      >ValiditorFn</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's say for a hero, every stat must be within 0 and 20, and that the sum
    of all 4 stats must be less than 60.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll provide for this exercise a `createSingleStatControl()` helper
    function that we can use to create a FormControl for each of the relevant
    stats. This will use built-in validators to accomplish this.
  </p>

  <p>
    However to validate that the sum of all stats is less than 60, we'll have to
    create our own validator. The signature is already provided in this example.
    HINT: Be sure to inspect the docs for the ValidatorFn type to understand how
    to property implement our validator!
  </p>

  <p>
    The other interesting thing to consider for this exercise is how/where to
    provide meaningfull feedback to the user if the heroValidtor should fail!
