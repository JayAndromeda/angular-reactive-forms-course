    In this lesson, we'll look at async validators and learn about the execution
    order of synchronous vs. asynchronous validators.
  </p>

  <p>
    The given form already has synchronous validators on the child forms to make
    the various fields required and to have no numbers. There's also a
    synchronous validator that on the FormGroup that will give an error if the
    whole name is too long.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the `ApiService` already injected in the FullNameComponent to create an
    async validator that will call our fake API to verify that the name given by
    the user does not already exist in our system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Try playing around with this example - what happens if we fail a synchronous
    validator? Will the async validator still execute at all? What about the
    valid/invalid/status properties of the FormGroup? Why might these details be
    important?

    In this exercise, we'll see how we can use an async validator in conjunction
    with an NgRx selector to validate a form against store contents!
  </p>

  <p>
    In this simple example, we'll let a user submit names via a form. Once a
    name is submitted, it is added to the store, and the form should then
    validate any user input to give an error if the name already exists.

    >
    to inspect the contents of your store, and checkout the store implementation
    in the `libs/secion2/src/lib/+state` directory.
