    To get started with Validators, let's start with the built-in validators
    provided by the Angular Forms API. We can find a full list of the provided
    built-in validators in the Angular Docs.

    For this first exercise, create a new `FormControl` for the email input
    below. Use the built-in validators to make this field be required, have a
    minimum length of 5, and be in valid email format.

    For this next exercise, we'll revisit the Hero Form that we created in our
    previous exercise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagine we had some business logic that stated that a name is required for
    each hero, and the maximum value for any hero stat is 20, and the minimum is
    0. Let's implement those constraints on the FormGroup we created and watch
    how the errors and status of the FormGroup behaves.
